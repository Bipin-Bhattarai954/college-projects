     <h1>Chapter 1:Computer System</h1>
     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <P>Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word 
      "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as
       an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device, process 
       it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, 
       store it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information
        as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on
         IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm 
         which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic 
         operation of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.</P>

  <p><strong>Introduction to computer system</strong></p>
<p> A system is a set of detailed methods, procedures, and routines created to carry out a specific activity, perform a duty, or solve a problem. In a system, different units coordinate with each other so that they work as a whole. Without any of the units, the whole system is affected.</p>
<p>Similarly, a computer system is also a combination of hardware, software, and peripherals which are organized together to run our computer system smoothly. Basically, our computer system works on the IPO (Input Process Output) cycle. So, it is mandatory/compulsory for different units to work together as a whole in order to convert raw facts and figures into meaningful information. Without any one of these units, the computer starts malfunctioning.</p>
<p>The design, arrangement, construction, or organization of the different parts of the computer system is known as computer architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Components/Elements of Computer System</strong></p>
<p>A computer system has several basic components or elements which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware (Input, Output, Processing, and Storage)</li>
  <li>Software</li>
  <li>Data/Information</li>
  <li>Procedure</li>
  <li>People</li>
  <li>Communication</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hardware:</strong> Hardware is the physical devices on the computer which we can touch and see. Without hardware, software cannot work. For example: devices like keyboard, mouse, CPU, hard disk, and RAM are commonly used hardware devices.</p>

<p><strong>Software:</strong> The collection of instructions is known as a program, which performs some specific function. Software describes how hardware should function and helps in proper utilization and mobilization of computer hardware. For example: Operating system, MS-Office, Billing software, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Data/Information:</strong> The raw facts and figures that are isolated, uninterpreted, and don't give any sense are known as data. Whereas, the meaningful result obtained after processing data according to the supplied instruction is known as information.</p>

<p><strong>People/User:</strong> It is the most important part of the computer system. People operate the computer hardware and create the computer software. People help generate commands to operate the computer system. Without the user, no hardware and software can be mobilized.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Procedures are the description of how things are done. It includes steps for converting raw facts and figures into meaningful information. It includes the general guidelines of how the computer should be used.</p>

<p><strong>Communication:</strong> The data are shared among different components of our computer system in the form of electronic signals. The exchange of data and information between several components can also be termed as communication.</p>

<p><strong>Basic hardware components of a computer system:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Input unit</li>
  <li>Output unit</li>
  <li>Processing unit</li>
  <li>Storage unit</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Input Unit:</strong> The input device accepts data and instructions from the user; hence the device or unit used to feed raw facts and figures to the computer system for processing, along with a set of instructions, is called the input unit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It accepts the list of instructions and data from the outside world.</li>
  <li>It converts the supplied instructions and data into computer-acceptable form (binary code).</li>
  <li>It supplies the converted instructions and data to the computer system for further processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the commonly used input devices are: Keyboard, trackpad, touchscreen, mouse, light pen, scanner, BCR, MICR, OCR, joystick, trackball, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Output Unit:</strong> The job of the output unit is just the reverse of an input unit. It supplies information and the result of computation to the outside world. Thus, it links the computer with the external environment. </p>
<ul>
  <li>It accepts the result produced by the computer, which is not understandable to us.</li>
  <li>It converts the result into a human-understandable form.</li>
  <li>It supplies the converted results to the outside world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commonly used output devices are: Monitor, printers, speakers, plotters, etc.</p>

<p>There are two types of output devices:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Hard Copy output:</strong> These types of output are in print form on paper or some material that can be touched and carried to be shown to others. It is permanent in nature, so we can look after these outputs even if there is no computer. Unlike soft copy output, these types of output do not need a continuous supply of power. For example, the output produced on paper or other materials by printers or plotters is known as hard copy output, and the device is known as a hard copy output device. The commonly used hard copy output devices are printers and plotters.</li>
  <li><strong>Soft Copy output:</strong> Soft copy output refers to the data shown on the display screen or produced by the speaker. These types of output are untouchable. They are temporary in nature, meaning the output cannot be carried to be shown to others. These types of output exist only when there is a computer or continuous electricity supply. It is non-portable compared to hard copy output. For example, the output produced on the display screen or the sound produced from the speaker is soft copy output, and the devices are known as soft copy output devices. The commonly used soft copy output devices are speakers and monitors.</li>

  <strong>23. What do you understand by computer software? Name various categories of them, giving at least one example of each. [HSEB 2062]</strong><br>
  Computer software is a set of programs that instruct the computer on how to perform tasks. Categories include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>System software (e.g., operating systems)</li>
  <li>Application software (e.g., word processors)</li>
  <li>Utility software (e.g., antivirus programs)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>24. What do you mean by system software and application software? [HSEB 2064]</strong><br>
  System software controls and manages hardware (for example, operating systems), while application software helps users perform specific tasks (for example, spreadsheet programs).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>25. Define software. Explain the different types of software in detail. [HSEB 2064]</strong><br>
  Software is a collection of programs and data used to operate a computer. It is generally divided into:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>System software: Manages hardware and provides a platform for applications.</li>
  <li>Application software: Helps users perform tasks such as document creation or data analysis.</li>
  <li>Utility software: Provides maintenance and optimization functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>26. Describe the differences between serial and parallel interfaces. [HSEB 2061]</strong><br>
  A serial interface sends data one bit at a time over a single channel, while a parallel interface sends multiple bits simultaneously over multiple channels. Serial is often simpler and less expensive, whereas parallel can offer faster data transfer over short distances.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>27. Describe different types of software. [HSEB 2070]</strong><br>
  Software can be categorized into:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>System software – such as operating systems that manage hardware.</li>
  <li>Application software – like word processors that help users create content.</li>
  <li>Utility software – programs designed to maintain and optimize computer performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>28. Describe the Impact Printers with examples. [HSEB 2071]</strong><br>
  Impact printers work by striking a print head against an ink ribbon, which in turn makes contact with the paper. Examples include dot matrix and daisy wheel printers. They are known for their ability to create carbon copies and for their rugged construction.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>29. Describe different types of software. [HSEB 2071]</strong><br>
  Software is divided into system software, application software, and utility software. System software, such as an operating system, controls hardware; application software, like a text editor, helps perform specific tasks; and utility software assists in system maintenance.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>30. List out the functions of CPU. [HSEB 2071]</strong><br>
  The CPU performs several key functions including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic and logical operations</li>
  <li>Instruction execution</li>
  <li>Data movement between memory and peripherals</li>
  <li>Control of the overall system operations</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>31. Write short notes on:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>(a) MICR [HSEB 2064/2071]</strong><br>
    MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) uses magnetic ink and special fonts on checks. A magnetic sensor reads the printed characters by detecting their magnetic properties, which speeds up and secures banking transactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(b) Joystick [HSEB 2066/2070]</strong><br>
    A joystick is an input device that detects the tilt and movement of a stick. It converts this movement into electrical signals that control movement in video games and simulations, offering precise directional input.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(c) Scanner [HSEB 2065/2070]</strong><br>
    A scanner converts paper documents into digital form by illuminating the document with a light source. Sensors then capture the reflected light, and the device converts it into digital data, creating a high-quality image of the original.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(d) Light pen [HSEB 2065]</strong><br>
    A light pen is a pointing device that detects light from a computer screen. When moved over the screen, it senses changes in light intensity, allowing the computer to pinpoint the location for user interaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(e) OCR [HSEB 2071]</strong><br>
    OCR (Optical Character Recognition) converts printed or handwritten text into digital text. It scans the document with optical sensors, recognizes the shape of each character, and translates them into editable text for digital use.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(f) Touch Screen [HSEB 2060]</strong><br>
    A touch screen is an interactive display that detects user input through touch. It uses capacitive or resistive sensing technology to convert the pressure or electrical changes from a finger or stylus into digital signals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(g) Compiler versus Interpreter [HSEB 2067]</strong><br>
    A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before execution, creating a standalone executable file. An interpreter reads and executes code line by line during runtime, which helps in debugging but can be slower.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(h) Cache Memory [HSEB 2067]</strong><br>
    Cache memory is a small, fast storage that temporarily holds frequently used data. It works by storing a copy of data from the main memory, so the CPU can access it quickly, thereby enhancing overall system speed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(i) Laser printer [HSEB 2064, 2065]</strong><br>
    A laser printer uses a laser beam to project an image onto a photoconductive drum. The drum attracts toner particles in the pattern of the image and then transfers and fuses them onto paper using heat, producing sharp, high-quality prints.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(j) Modem [HSEB 2066]</strong><br>
    A modem (Modulator-Demodulator) converts digital signals from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines and then converts incoming analog signals back into digital form. This allows data to be sent over long distances using existing phone networks.
  </li>
